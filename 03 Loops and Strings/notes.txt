//todo: Instead of for loops, while loops and do-while loops there are two more loops which are based upon iterations...

1.) for-of loops
->  let str = "Harsh";
    for(let i of str){
        console.log("i = ",i);
    }

2.) for-in loops
-> (generally this loop is use in the Arrays and Objects)

    for(let i in product){
        console.log(i); // it will print all the key of the student object
    }

//todo: Template Literals in JS
-> A way to have embedded expressions in String
   `This is a template literal`

   //todo: String Interpolation
   -> To create strings by doing substitutions of placeholders
     e.g., `My name is ${inputName}, and I am learning ${subjectName}`
