JS is a programming language. We use it to give instructions to the computer.

JS is a dynamically typed language, no need to mention the datatype to any variable...

JS variables are case-sensitive...

Input(code) -> Computer -> Output

Console is a part of browser where we can write the JS Code...
ctrl+K -> to clean the console
ctrl+R -> to reload the website/console

giving *null vs undefined* to a variable

undefined -> don't know what is inside this variable
null -> we know that nothing is inside this variable

//todo: Var, Let & Const...

var -> Variable can be redeclared and updated. A global scope variable
let -> Variable cann't be redeclared but can be updated. A block scope variable
const -> Variable neither redeclared nor updated. A block scope variable

//todo: Datatypes in JS
 1.) Primitve Datatypes(7):
    > Number (can be +ve, -ve, decimal, integer, double, etc)
    > String (any txt data- e.g., name, address, etc)
    > Boolean (true or false)
    > undefined (the varibale having no value initialized considered as undefined)
    > null (means an absence of an object, exploring later)
    > BigInt (to store large integers, e.g. let x = BigInt("123456") -> o/p -> 123456n)
    > Symbol (let y = Symbol("Hello!") -> o/p -> Symbol("Hello!") )

 2.) Non-Primitve Datatypes:
    > Object(Incl. Arrays and functions)
        e.g -> Key value pair in a block...
        const student = {
            name: "Harsh",
            roll: 11,
            section: "K23EU",
            age: 19,
            isPass: true
        }

    How to access the object value :- 2 ways->
        > student["roll"]
        > student.roll
